   <p>Hi everyone! I am Izzy Alba and this is my second to last semester. I am from Salem, Oregon
       and I have five sisters and one brother. I served a mission in Brazil.
       <p>I really enjoy watching and playing sports. I also
        enjoy the outdoors such as hiking and camping. I am a Business Management major with an emphasis in Marketing. I am taking
        this class becasue I want to learn more about how the web works.
